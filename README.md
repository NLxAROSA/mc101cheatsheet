# Cheat Sheet - Roland MC-101 Groovebox

![Roland MC-101 Diagram](mc-101.PNG)

Hi there, and welcome to the unofficial Cheat Sheet for the [Roland MC-101 Groovebox](https://www.roland.com/global/products/mc-101/)! 

This Cheat Sheet aims to provide a one or two pager of the most useful shortcuts and workflow operations of this nifty little Groovebox. Please note that you'll be able to find *most* (though not *all*!) of these by reading the manuals, but who has time for that, right? ;)

## How to read this cheat sheet

Everything in **bold** refers to a control (a button, knob or slider) on the front panel of the MC-101 (see picture above). 

A **+** (**plus-sign**) between two or more controls indicates that those controls should be used simultaneously, in the specified order. 

A **,** (**comma**) between two or more controls indicates that those controls should be used sequentially, in the specified order.

## Completeness and correctness
First of all, this is a work-in-progress (WIP) until specified differently. Currently in Markdown format, might make a nice looking PDF out of it once it's done.

Though I always strive to be complete and correct, there's always the chance that there's something missing or just plain wrong in here. Should that be the case then make good use of the [New Issue](https://github.com/NLxAROSA/mc101cheatsheet/issues/new/choose) button from the [Issues](https://github.com/NLxAROSA/mc101cheatsheet/issues) tab above. Or even better: [New Pull Request](https://github.com/NLxAROSA/mc101cheatsheet/compare) from the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/NLxAROSA/mc101cheatsheet/pulls) tab! 

Anyway, enough chitchat, see below for the Cheat Sheet!
